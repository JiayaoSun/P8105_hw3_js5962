**Problem 1**

``` r
data("instacart")

# How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items ordered from?
instacart %>%
  count(aisle) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 134 × 2
    ##    aisle                              n
    ##    <chr>                          <int>
    ##  1 fresh vegetables              150609
    ##  2 fresh fruits                  150473
    ##  3 packaged vegetables fruits     78493
    ##  4 yogurt                         55240
    ##  5 packaged cheese                41699
    ##  6 water seltzer sparkling water  36617
    ##  7 milk                           32644
    ##  8 chips pretzels                 31269
    ##  9 soy lactosefree                26240
    ## 10 bread                          23635
    ## # … with 124 more rows

134 aisles in total.

Then, make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle,
limiting this to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered. Arrange
aisles sensibly, and organize your plot so others can read it.

``` r
instacart %>% 
    count(aisle) %>% 
    filter(n > 10000) %>% 
    mutate(
        aisle = factor(aisle),
        aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, n)
    ) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n)) + 
    geom_point() + 
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1)) +
  labs(
    title = "Number of items ordered per aisle",
    x = "Aisle",
    y = "Number of items",
    caption = "limit aisles with more than 10,000 items ordered")
```

Next, make a table showing the three most popular items in each of the
aisles “baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged vegetables
fruits”. Include the number of times each item is ordered in your table.

``` r
instacart %>% 
    filter(
      aisle %in% 
        c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) %>% 
    group_by(aisle) %>% 
    count(product_name) %>% 
    mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(n))) %>% 
    filter(rank <= 3) %>% 
    arrange(aisle, rank) %>% 
    knitr::kable()
```

| aisle                      | product\_name                                 |    n | rank |
|:---------------------------|:----------------------------------------------|-----:|-----:|
| baking ingredients         | Light Brown Sugar                             |  499 |    1 |
| baking ingredients         | Pure Baking Soda                              |  387 |    2 |
| baking ingredients         | Cane Sugar                                    |  336 |    3 |
| dog food care              | Snack Sticks Chicken & Rice Recipe Dog Treats |   30 |    1 |
| dog food care              | Organix Chicken & Brown Rice Recipe           |   28 |    2 |
| dog food care              | Small Dog Biscuits                            |   26 |    3 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Baby Spinach                          | 9784 |    1 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Raspberries                           | 5546 |    2 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Blueberries                           | 4966 |    3 |

Next, make a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady
Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week; format
this table for human readers (i.e. produce a 2 x 7 table).

``` r
instacart %>% 
    filter(
      product_name %in% 
        c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) %>% 
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) %>%  # the day of the week on which the order was placed
  summarize(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)) %>% # the hour of the day on which the order was placed
    pivot_wider(
        names_from = order_dow,
        values_from = mean_hour
    ) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

| product\_name    |        0 |        1 |        2 |        3 |        4 |        5 |        6 |
|:-----------------|---------:|---------:|---------:|---------:|---------:|---------:|---------:|
| Coffee Ice Cream | 13.77419 | 14.31579 | 15.38095 | 15.31818 | 15.21739 | 12.26316 | 13.83333 |
| Pink Lady Apples | 13.44118 | 11.36000 | 11.70213 | 14.25000 | 11.55172 | 12.78431 | 11.93750 |

***A short description of the data set***

**Problem 2**

``` r
data("brfss_smart2010")
```

First, do data cleaning

``` r
brfss_df = 
  janitor::clean_names(brfss_smart2010) %>%
  filter(topic == "Overall Health") %>%
  filter(response == "Excellent" | response == "Very good" | response == "Good" | response == "Fair" | response == "Poor") %>%
  mutate(respone = as.factor(response),
  response = forcats::fct_relevel(response, c("Poor", "Fair", "Good", "Very good", "Excellent")))
```

In 2002, which states were observed at 7 or more locations? What about
in 2010?

``` r
# in 2002
brfss_df %>%
  filter(year == "2002") %>%
  group_by(locationabbr) %>%
  distinct(locationdesc) %>%
  summarize(numbers_of_tested_locations = n()) %>%
  filter(numbers_of_tested_locations > 6) %>%
  arrange(numbers_of_tested_locations) %>%
  knitr::kable(caption = "Note: states observed at 7 or more location in 2002 as above.")
```

| locationabbr | numbers\_of\_tested\_locations |
|:-------------|-------------------------------:|
| CT           |                              7 |
| FL           |                              7 |
| NC           |                              7 |
| MA           |                              8 |
| NJ           |                              8 |
| PA           |                             10 |

Note: states observed at 7 or more location in 2002 as above.

``` r
# in 2010
brfss_df %>%
  filter(year == "2010") %>%
  group_by(locationabbr) %>%
  distinct(locationdesc) %>%
  summarize(numbers_of_tested_locations = n()) %>%
  filter(numbers_of_tested_locations > 6) %>%
  arrange(numbers_of_tested_locations) %>%
  knitr::kable(caption = "Note: states observed at 7 or more location in 2010 as above.")
```

| locationabbr | numbers\_of\_tested\_locations |
|:-------------|-------------------------------:|
| CO           |                              7 |
| PA           |                              7 |
| SC           |                              7 |
| OH           |                              8 |
| MA           |                              9 |
| NY           |                              9 |
| NE           |                             10 |
| WA           |                             10 |
| CA           |                             12 |
| MD           |                             12 |
| NC           |                             12 |
| TX           |                             16 |
| NJ           |                             19 |
| FL           |                             41 |

Note: states observed at 7 or more location in 2010 as above.

*Comment:* 6 states were observed at 7 or more locations in 2002. 14
states were observed at 7 or more locations in 2010, which is larger
compared to 2002.

Next, construct a data set that is limited to Excellent responses, and
contains, year, state, and a variable that averages the data\_value
across locations within a state. Make a “spaghetti” plot of this average
value over time within a state (that is, make a plot showing a line for
each state across years – the geom\_line geometry and group aesthetic
will help).

``` r
brfss_excellent =
  brfss_df %>%
  filter(response == "Excellent") %>%
  group_by(year, locationabbr) %>%
  mutate(average_data_value = mean(data_value, na.rm = TRUE))
# create plots
brfss_excellent %>%
ggplot(aes(x = year, y = average_data_value, group = locationabbr, color = locationabbr)) + 
  geom_line() +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +
  labs(
    title = "Average data value of each state in 2002-2010",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Average data value", 
    caption = "Note: Data from brfss_smart2010 ") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

![](p8105_hw3_files/figure-gfm/2b-1.png)<!-- -->

*Comment:* The average data value of most states has a slightly decrease
with fluctuation from 2002 to 2010. However, West Virginia has an
obvious drop down in 2005.

Make a two-panel plot showing, for the years 2006, and 2010,
distribution of data\_value for responses (“Poor” to “Excellent”) among
locations in NY State.

``` r
brfss_df %>%
  filter(year == "2006" | year == "2010",locationabbr == "NY") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = response, y = data_value)) +
  geom_col() +
  facet_wrap(~year,scales = "fixed") + 
    labs(
    title = "Distribution of data value in 2006 and 2010 in NY (Overall Health)",
    x = "Response",
    y = "Data value",
    caption = "Note: Data from brfss_smart2010 ") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

![](p8105_hw3_files/figure-gfm/2c-1.png)<!-- -->

*Comment:* For both years, response “very good” occupied most and “Poor”
occupied least. Overall, there are more responses in 2010 compared to
2006.

**Problem 3**

Accelerometers have become an appealing alternative to self-report
techniques for studying physical activity in observational studies and
clinical trials, largely because of their relative objectivity. During
observation periods, the devices measure “activity counts” in a short
period; one-minute intervals are common. Because accelerometers can be
worn comfortably and unobtrusively, they produce around-the-clock
observations.
